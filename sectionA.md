##Indentation

Your function `groupAnagrams(self, strs)`on line 3 has inconsistant indentation, Python depends on regular indentation to keep the code clean. Syntax problems can be caused by inconsistent indentation, such as utilising varying levels of indentation or combining tabs and spaces. To improve your code reliability and prevent misinterpretation use this resource: `https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_indentation.asp#:~:text=Indentation%20refers%20to%20the%20spaces,indicate%20a%20block%20of%20code.` to learn more about indentation.

##Documentation

By adding comments to your code, makes it easier for future you and other developers to read and understand. Code that is well-documented offers concise descriptions of its objective, functionality, and application, making it simpler for others to understand the code's motivations. Use this resource: `https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/23/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/` to help you with code comments.

##Variable naming

Your variable names make sense because they correspond to the function or significance of the information they contain. You just need to fix a few things, and your code will be effective and please utilise the tools I provided for you. Thank you.
