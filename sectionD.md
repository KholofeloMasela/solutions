##Option 1: Student Progress

Provide individualised support. To address the student's unique issues, I will arrange individual meetings, offer
additional resources, or offer assistance. This enables me to give each student individualised attention, respond to
their inquiries, and provide assistance based on their requirements. This may include recommending appropriate textbooks,
online guides, teaching videos, or exercise routines that can help with knowledge and present more opportunity for practise.

I can plan small-group workshops so students who grasp concepts well and can assist those who are having trouble.
Students can assist one another, ask questions, and gain from peer interactions in this encouraging setting for
collaborative learning. I will encourage them to adopt a growth attitude by highlighting the fact that mistakes are a
necessary component of learning.

##Option 2: Java Support Task

Determine whether the loop and its variables have been written in accordance with Java standards, Look at the loop
condition that controls whether the loop should be continued. Verify that the condition is properly defined and 
that it is possible to satisfy the loop termination requirement.

Visually follow the code's flow as it is being executed to spot any logical flaws or unexpected events that might
prohibit the method from storing the variable. Be mindful of the loop's side effects, conditional statements, and the
sequence in which the actions are performed.
